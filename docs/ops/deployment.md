# Deployment

Overview
- This document outlines considerations for deploying Huginn to staging/production environments.

Recommendations
- Containerize services and use docker compose or Kubernetes for orchestration.
- Store secrets in a secure vault or environment-specific secret manager.
- Use separate .env files per environment but never commit them.
- Set up CI/CD to build images, run tests, and deploy on merge to main.

Environments
- Development: local via docker compose.
- Staging: mirrors production with lower capacity. Enable extra logging.
- Production: hardened configuration, minimal debug, autoscaling where possible.

Health and monitoring
- Add health endpoints for each service.
- Aggregate logs (ELK, Loki) and metrics (Prometheus).

Backups
- If databases or stateful services are introduced, schedule backups and retention policies.
